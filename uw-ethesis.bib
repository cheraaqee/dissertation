abstract = {Most publicly available image quality databases have been created under highly controlled conditions by introducing graded simulated distortions onto high-quality photographs. However, images captured using typical real-world mobile camera devices are usually afflicted by complex mixtures of multiple distortions, which are not necessarily well-modeled by the synthetic distortions found in existing databases. The originators of existing legacy databases usually conducted human psychometric studies to obtain statistically meaningful sets of human opinion scores on images in a stringently controlled visual environment, resulting in small data collections relative to other kinds of image analysis databases. Towards overcoming these limitations, we designed and created a new database that we call the LIVE In the Wild Image Quality Challenge Database, which contains widely diverse authentic image distortions on a large number of images captured using a representative variety of modern mobile devices. We also designed and implemented a new online crowdsourcing system, which we have used to conduct a very large-scale, multi-month image quality assessment subjective study. Our database consists of over 350000 opinion scores on 1162 images evaluated by over 7000 unique human observers. Despite the lack of control over the experimental environments of the numerous study participants, we demonstrate excellent internal consistency of the subjective dataset. We also evaluate several top-performing blind Image Quality Assessment algorithms on it and present insights on how mixtures of distortions challenge both end users as well as automatic perceptual quality prediction models.},

abstract = {In this work we describe a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to accurately predict image quality without a reference image. Taking image patches as input, the CNN works in the spatial domain without using hand-crafted features that are employed by most previous methods. The network consists of one convolutional layer with max and min pooling, two fully connected layers and an output node. Within the network structure, feature learning and regression are integrated into one optimization process, which leads to a more effective model for estimating image quality. This approach achieves state of the art performance on the LIVE dataset and shows excellent generalization ability in cross dataset experiments. Further experiments on images with local distortions demonstrate the local quality estimation ability of our CNN, which is rarely reported in previous literature.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Image quality assessment (IQA) has been a topic of intense research over the last several decades. With each year comes an increasing number of new IQA algorithms, extensions of existing IQA algorithms, and applications of IQA to other disciplines. In this article, I first provide an up-to-date review of research in IQA, and then I highlight several open challenges in this field. The first half of this article provides discuss key properties of visual perception, image quality databases, existing full-reference, no-reference, and reduced-reference IQA algorithms. Yet, despite the remarkable progress that has been made in IQA, many fundamental challenges remain largely unsolved. The second half of this article highlights some of these challenges. I specifically discuss challenges related to lack of complete perceptual models for: natural images, compound and suprathreshold distortions, and multiple distortions, and the interactive effects of these distortions on the images. I also discuss challenges related to IQA of images containing nontraditional, and I discuss challenges related to the computational efficiency. The goal of this article is not only to help practitioners and researchers keep abreast of the recent advances in IQA, but to also raise awareness of the key limitations of current IQA knowledge.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Manap2015,
abstract = {Over the last two decades, there has been a surge of interest in the research of image quality assessment due to its wide applicability to many domains. In general, the aim of image quality assessment algorithms is to evaluate the perceptual quality of an image using an objective index which should be highly consistent with the human subjective index. The objective image quality assessment algorithms can be classified into three main classes: full-reference, reduced-reference, and no-reference. While full-reference and reduced-reference algorithms require full information or partial information of the reference image respectively, no reference information is required for no-reference algorithms. Consequently, a no-reference (or blind) image quality assessment algorithm is highly preferred in cases where the availability of any reference information is implausible. In this paper, a survey of the recent no-reference image quality algorithms, specifically for non-distortion-specific cases, is provided in the first half of this paper. Two major approaches in designing the non-distortion-specific no-reference algorithms, namely natural scene statistics-based and learning-based, are studied. In the second half of this paper, their performance and limitations are discussed before current research trends addressing the limitations are presented. Finally, possible future research directions are proposed towards the end of this paper.},

abstract = {With the increasing demand for video-based applications, the reliable prediction of video quality has increased in importance. Numerous video quality assessment methods and metrics have been proposed over the past years with varying computational complexity and accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a classification scheme for full-reference and reduced-reference media-layer objective video quality assessment methods. Our classification scheme first classifies a method according to whether natural visual characteristics or perceptual (human visual system) characteristics are considered. We further subclassify natural visual characteristics methods into methods based on natural visual statistics or natural visual features. We subclassify perceptual characteristics methods into frequency- or pixel-domain methods. According to our classification scheme, we comprehensively review and compare the media-layer objective video quality models for both standard resolution and high definition video. We find that the natural visual statistics based MultiScale-Structural SIMilarity index (MS-SSIM), the natural visual feature based Video Quality Metric (VQM), and the perceptual spatio-temporal frequency-domain based MOtion-based Video Integrity Evaluation (MOVIE) index give the best performance for the LIVE Video Quality Database.},

@article{Chandler2010,
abstract = {The mainstream approach to image quality assessment has centered around accurately modeling the single most relevant strategy employed by the human visual system (HVS) when judging image quality (e.g., detecting visible differences, and extracting image structure/information). In this work, we suggest that a single strategy may not be sufficient; rather, we advocate that the HVS uses multiple strategies to determine image quality. For images containing near-threshold distortions, the image is most apparent, and thus the HVS attempts to look past the image and look for the distortions (a detection-based strategy). For images containing clearly visible distortions, the distortions are most apparent, and thus the HVS attempts to look past the distortion and look for the image's subject matter (an appearance-based strategy). Here, we present a quality assessment method [most apparent distortion (MAD)], which attempts to explicitly model these two separate strategies. Local luminance and contrast masking are used to estimate detection-based perceived distortion in high-quality images, whereas changes in the local statistics of spatial-frequency components are used to estimate appearance-based perceived distortion in low-quality images. We show that a combination of these two measures can perform well in predicting subjective ratings of image quality.},

abstract = {This paper describes a recently created image database, TID2013, intended for evaluation of full-reference visual quality assessment metrics. With respect to TID2008, the new database contains a larger number (3000) of test images obtained from 25 reference images, 24 types of distortions for each reference image, and 5 levels for each type of distortion. Motivations for introducing 7 new types of distortions and one additional level of distortions are given; examples of distorted images are presented. Mean opinion scores (MOS) for the new database have been collected by performing 985 subjective experiments with volunteers (observers) from five countries (Finland, France, Italy, Ukraine, and USA). The availability of MOS allows the use of the designed database as a fundamental tool for assessing the effectiveness of visual quality. Furthermore, existing visual quality metrics have been tested with the proposed database and the collected results have been analyzed using rank order correlation coefficients between MOS and considered metrics. These correlation indices have been obtained both considering the full set of distorted images and specific image subsets, for highlighting advantages and drawbacks of existing, state of the art, quality metrics. Approaches to thorough performance analysis for a given metric are presented to detect practical situations or distortion types for which this metric is not adequate enough to human perception. The created image database and the collected MOS values are freely available for downloading and utilization for scientific purposes.},

Existing subjective studies primarily have records of human ratings on images that were corrupted by only one of many possible distortions. However, the majority of images that are available for consumption are corrupted by multiple distortions. Towards broadening the corpora of records of human responses to visual distortions, we recently conducted a study on two types of multiply distorted images to obtain human judgments of the visual quality of such images. Further, we compared the performance of several existing objective image quality measures on the new database and analyze the effects of multiple distortions on commonly used quality-determinant features and on human ratings.},

abstract = {In practice, images available to consumers usually undergo several stages of processing including acquisition, compression, transmission, and presentation, and each stage may introduce certain type of distortion. It is common that images are simultaneously distorted by multiple types of distortions. Most existing objective image quality assessment (IQA) methods have been designed to estimate perceived quality of images corrupted by a single image processing stage. In this letter, we propose a no-reference (NR) IQA method to predict the visual quality of multiply-distorted images based on structural degradation. In the proposed method, a novel structural feature is extracted as the gradient-weighted histogram of local binary pattern (LBP) calculated on the gradient map (GWH-GLBP), which is effective to describe the complex degradation pattern introduced by multiple distortions. Extensive experiments conducted on two public multiply-distorted image databases have demonstrated that the proposed GWH-GLBP metric compares favorably with existing full-reference and NR IQA methods in terms of high accordance with human subjective ratings.},

The database contains 20 reference images and 1600 distorted images. The latter images are obtained by contamination of the former with multiple distortions of random types and levels, so multiple types of distortions appear in each distorted image. Pair comparison sorting (PCS) is used as a new subjective rating method to evaluate image quality. This method allows subjects to make equal decisions on images whose difference in quality cannot be easily evaluated visually. A total of 192 subjects participated in the subjective rating, in which mean opinion scores and standard deviations were obtained. In IQA research, subjective scores and algorithm predictions are generally related by a nonlinear regression. We further propose a method to initialize the parameters of the nonlinear regression. The experiments of IQA metrics conducted on MDID validate that this database is advisable and challenging.},

To address this issue, in this paper we propose a quaternion wavelet transform (QWT) based full reference image quality assessment (FR IQA) metric for multiply distorted images, which jointly considers the local similarity of phase and magnitude of each subband via QWT. Firstly, the reference images and distorted images are decomposed by QWT, and then the similarity of amplitude and phase are calculated on each subband, thirdly the IQA metric is constructed by the weighting method considering human visual system (HVS) characteristics, and lastly the scores of each subband are averaged to get the quality score of test image. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state of art in multiply distorted IQA.},

The structural information is captured from the predicted image by using a shearlet representation and R{\'{e}}nyi directional entropy is deployed to measure the disorderly information changes. Finally, we introduce the application of a framework namely Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI) to build a quality model and obtain quality scores. During training, the LUPI framework utilizes a set of additional privileged data to learn an improved quality model. Experimental results on multiply-distorted image datasets (MLIVE and MDID2015) confirm the effectiveness of the proposed IQA model.},

abstract = {Multiply-distorted images, that is, distorted by different types of distortions simultaneously, are so common in real applications. This kind of images contain multiple overlaying stages (e.g., acquisition, compression and transmission stage). Each stage will introduce a certain type of distortion, for example, sensor noise in acquisition stage and compression artifacts in compression stage. However, most current blind/no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) methods are specifically designed for singly-distorted images, thus resulting in their deficiency in handling multiply-distorted images. Motivated by the hypothesis that human visual system (HVS) is adapted to the structural information in images, we attempt to assess multiply-distorted images based on structural degradation. To this end, we use both first- and high-order image structures to design a novel referenceless quality metric for multiply-distorted images. Specifically, we leverage the quality-aware features extracted from both the gradient-magnitude map and contrast-normalized map, and further improve the performance by making use of redundancy of features with random subspace method. Experimental results on popular multiply-distorted image databases verify the outstanding performance of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Perceptual image quality assessment (IQA) plays an important role in numerous applications, including image restoration, compression, enhancement, and others. Although many works have been conducted on individually distorted IQA problems and have achieved encouraging results, few studies have been conducted on multiple distorted (MD) IQA problems. Thus, limited progress has been made. In this paper, we propose a novel no reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) method, named improved multiscale local binary pattern (IMLBP), for addressing multiply distorted IQA problems. The image structures are sensitive to image distortions, which motivates us to utilize the structural characteristics for overall image quality prediction. We improved the local binary pattern (LBP) by considering the human visual mechanism to better extract the structural information. The IMLBP contains two parts, the LBP and the radius difference LBP (DLBP). The DLBP reflects the values' changes in the radial direction. Specifically, when the radius value is small, the proposed descriptor is computed to represent microstructural information. Conversely, it represents macrostructural information when the radius becomes large. Moreover, to better mimick the human visual mechanism, the IMLBP is computed with the multiscale strategy and the operation is based on a patch unit whose size is proportional to the radius value. The frequency histogram of feature maps is transformed to feature vectors. Subsequently, a predictable function trained by the support vector regression is used to infer the overall quality score. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms most state-of-the-art IQA metrics on publicly available multiply distorted image databases. {\textcopyright} 1999-2012 IEEE.},

Local complementary structural information and a deep learning method are employed to blindly evaluate the quality of multiply distorted images. First, a monogenic signal representation is utilized to decompose a multiply distorted image into three complementary components: orientation, phase, and magnitude. The quality-predictive features are then determined from the complementary components. Finally, the features are mapped to the human quality score of the multiply distorted image based on the deep neural network.

Only limited work has been reported for assessing video quality under different spatial and temporal resolutions. In this paper, we consider a wider scope of video quality assessment in the sense of considering multiple dimensions. In particular, we address the problem of evaluating perceptual visual quality of low bit-rate videos under different settings and requirements. Extensive subjective view tests for assessing the perceptual quality of low bit-rate videos have been conducted, which cover 150 test scenarios and include five distinctive dimensions: encoder type, video content, bit rate, frame size, and frame rate. Based on the obtained subjective testing results, we perform thorough statistical analysis to study the influence of different dimensions on the perceptual quality and some interesting observations are pointed out. We believe such a study brings new knowledge into the topic of cross-dimensional video quality assessment and it has immediate applications in perceptual video adaptation for scalable video over mobile networks. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 1999-2012 IEEE.A new reference-free, objective, video quality prediction model that takes into account video content type to predict the quality of streamed high efficiency video coding (HEVC) encoded video sequences is proposed. Research has shown that for the same encoder settings and network quality of service (NQoS), the video quality differs for different types of video content. This indicates that, in addition to encoder settings and NQoS, there may be other key parameters that impact video quality. In this work, we hypothesized that video content type is one of the key parameters that may impact the quality of streamed videos. Based on this assertion, temporal information is extracted from the motion vector (MV) information inherent in the encoded video bitstreams and spatial information is extracted from the quantisation parameter (QP) and the number of bits (Bits) of coded intra (I) and predictive (P) frames to develop a metric that quantifies the content type of different video sequences. The content type metric is subsequently used together with encoding QP setting and network packet loss rate (PLR) to develop a reference -free objective video quality prediction model for streamed HEVC encoded video sequences. This model has an accuracy of 92{\%} when the model predicted values of sequences not used in model derivation are compared with mean opinion score (MOS) obtained through subjective method.},

While we expect (and indeed, hope) that the MSE will continue to be widely used as a signal fidelity measure, it is our greater desire to see more advanced signal fidelity measures being used, especially in applications where perceptual criteria might be relevant. Ideally, the performance of a new signal processing algorithm might be compared to other algorithms using several fidelity criteria.

abstract = {Measurement of visual quality is of fundamental importance to numerous image and video processing applications. The goal of quality assessment (QA) research is to design algorithms that can automatically assess the quality of images or videos in a perceptually consistent manner. Traditionally, image QA algorithms interpret image quality as fidelity or similarity with a "reference" or "perfecft" image in some perceptual space. Such "full-referenc" QA methods attempt to achieve consistency in quality prediction by modeling salient physiological and psychovisual features of the human visual system (HVS), or by arbitrary signal fidelity criteria. In this paper, we approach the problem of image QA by proposing a novel information fidelity criterion that is based on natural scene statistics. QA systems are invariably involved with judging the visual quality of images and videos that are meant for "human consumption." Researchers have developed sophisticated models to capture the statistics of natural signals, that is, pictures and videos of the visual environment. Using these statistical models in an information-theoretic setting, we derive a novel QA algorithm that provides clear advantages over the traditional approaches. In particular, it is parameterless and outperforms current methods in our testing. We validate the performance of our algorithm with an extensive subjective study involving 779 images. We also show that, although our approach distinctly departs from traditional HVS-based methods, it is functionally similar to them under certain conditions, yet it outperforms them due to improved modeling.

The goal of quality assessment (QA) research is to design algorithms that can automatically assess the quality of images or videos in a perceptually consistent manner. Image QA algorithms generally interpret image quality as fidelity or similarity with a "reference" or "perfect" image in some perceptual space. Such "full-reference" QA methods attempt to achieve consistency in quality prediction by modeling salient physiological and psychovisual features of the human visual system (HVS), or by signal fidelity measures. In this paper, we approach the image QA problem as an information fidelity problem. Specifically, we propose to quantify the loss of image information to the distortion process and explore the relationship between image information and visual quality. QA systems are invariably involved with judging the visual quality of "natural" images and videos that are meant for "human consumption." Researchers have developed sophisticated models to capture the statistics of such natural signals. Using these models, we previously presented an information fidelity criterion for image QA that related image quality with the amount of information shared between a reference and a distorted image. In this paper, we propose an image information measure that quantifies the information that is present in the reference image and how much of this reference information can be extracted from the distorted image. Combining these two quantities, we propose a visual information fidelity measure for image QA. We validate the performance of our algorithm with an extensive subjective study involving 779 images and show that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art image QA algorithms by a sizeable margin in our simulations.

abstract = {Perceptual image quality assessment (IQA) aims to use computational models to measure the image quality in consistent with subjective evaluations. Visual saliency (VS) has been widely studied by psychologists, neurobiologists, and computer scientists during the last decade to investigate, which areas of an image will attract the most attention of the human visual system. Intuitively, VS is closely related to IQA in that suprathreshold distortions can largely affect VS maps of images. With this consideration, we propose a simple but very effective full reference IQA method using VS. In our proposed IQA model, the role of VS is twofold. First, VS is used as a feature when computing the local quality map of the distorted image. Second, when pooling the quality score, VS is employed as a weighting function to reflect the importance of a local region. The proposed IQA index is called visual saliency-based index (VSI). Several prominent computational VS models have been investigated in the context of IQA and the best one is chosen for VSI. Extensive experiments performed on four large-scale benchmark databases demonstrate that the proposed IQA index VSI works better in terms of the prediction accuracy than all state-of-the-art IQA indices we can find while maintaining a moderate computational complexity. The MATLAB source code of VSI and the evaluation results are publicly available online at http://sse.tongji.edu.cn/linzhang/IQA/VSI/VSI.htm.},

The efficiency of the SVD-based image quality assessment (IQA) methods is related to its ability to extract the structural information of the viewing scene.

abstract = {This paper presents an efficient metric for quantifying the visual fidelity of natural images based on near-threshold and suprathreshold properties of human vision. The proposed metric, the visual signal-to-noise ratio (VSNR), operates via a two-stage approach. In the first stage, contrast thresholds for detection of distortions in the presence of natural images are computed via wavelet-based models of visual masking and visual summation in order to determine whether the distortions in the distorted image are visible. If the distortions are below the threshold of detection, the distorted image is deemed to be of perfect visual fidelity (VSNR = infinity) and no further analysis is required. If the distortions are suprathreshold, a second stage is applied which operates based on the low-level visual property of perceived contrast, and the mid-level visual property of global precedence. These two properties are modeled as Euclidean distances in distortion-contrast space of a multiscale wavelet decomposition, and VSNR is computed based on a simple linear sum of these distances. The proposed VSNR metric is generally competitive with current metrics of visual fidelity; it is efficient both in terms of its low computational complexity and in terms of its low memory requirements; and it operates based on physical luminances and visual angle (rather than on digital pixel values and pixel-based dimensions) to accommodate different viewing conditions.},

The well-known structural similarity index brings IQA from pixel- to structure-based stage. In this paper, a novel feature similarity (FSIM) index for full reference IQA is proposed based on the fact that human visual system (HVS) understands an image mainly according to its low-level features. Specifically, the phase congruency (PC), which is a dimensionless measure of the significance of a local structure, is used as the primary feature in FSIM. Considering that PC is contrast invariant while the contrast information does affect HVS' perception of image quality, the image gradient magnitude (GM) is employed as the secondary feature in FSIM. PC and GM play complementary roles in characterizing the image local quality. After obtaining the local quality map, we use PC again as a weighting function to derive a single quality score. Extensive experiments performed on six benchmark IQA databases demonstrate that FSIM can achieve much higher consistency with the subjective evaluations than state-of-the-art IQA metrics.},

abstract = {We propose a natural scene statistic-based distortion-generic blind/no-reference (NR) image quality assessment (IQA) model that operates in the spatial domain. The new model, dubbed blind/referenceless image spatial quality evaluator (BRISQUE) does not compute distortion-specific features, such as ringing, blur, or blocking, but instead uses scene statistics of locally normalized luminance coefficients to quantify possible losses of "naturalness" in the image due to the presence of distortions, thereby leading to a holistic measure of quality. The underlying features used derive from the empirical distribution of locally normalized luminances and products of locally normalized luminances under a spatial natural scene statistic model. No transformation to another coordinate frame (DCT, wavelet, etc.) is required, distinguishing it from prior NR IQA approaches. Despite its simplicity, we are able to show that BRISQUE is statistically better than the full-reference peak signal-to-noise ratio and the structural similarity index, and is highly competitive with respect to all present-day distortion-generic NR IQA algorithms. BRISQUE has very low computational complexity, making it well suited for real time applications. BRISQUE features may be used for distortion-identification as well. To illustrate a new practical application of BRISQUE, we describe how a nonblind image denoising algorithm can be augmented with BRISQUE in order to perform blind image denoising. Results show that BRISQUE augmentation leads to performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

The approach relies on a simple Bayesian inference model to predict image quality scores given certain extracted features. The features are based on an NSS model of the image DCT coefficients. The estimated parameters of the model are utilized to form features that are indicative of perceptual quality. These features are used in a simple Bayesian inference approach to predict quality scores. The resulting algorithm, which we name BLIINDS-II, requires minimal training and adopts a simple probabilistic model for score prediction. Given the extracted features from a test image, the quality score that maximizes the probability of the empirically determined inference model is chosen as the predicted quality score of that image. When tested on the LIVE IQA database, BLIINDS-II is shown to correlate highly with human judgments of quality, at a level that is competitive with the popular SSIM index.},

abstract = {We present a novel and practical deep fully convolutional neural network architecture for semantic pixel-wise segmentation termed SegNet. This core trainable segmentation engine consists of an encoder network, a corresponding decoder network followed by a pixel-wise classification layer. The architecture of the encoder network is topologically identical to the 13 convolutional layers in the VGG16 network. The role of the decoder network is to map the low resolution encoder feature maps to full input resolution feature maps for pixel-wise classification. The novelty of SegNet lies is in the manner in which the decoder upsamples its lower resolution input feature map(s). Specifically, the decoder uses pooling indices computed in the max-pooling step of the corresponding encoder to perform non-linear upsampling. This eliminates the need for learning to upsample. The upsampled maps are sparse and are then convolved with trainable filters to produce dense feature maps. We compare our proposed architecture with the widely adopted FCN and also with the well known DeepLab-LargeFOV, DeconvNet architectures. This comparison reveals the memory versus accuracy trade-off involved in achieving good segmentation performance. SegNet was primarily motivated by scene understanding applications. Hence, it is designed to be efficient both in terms of memory and computational time during inference. It is also significantly smaller in the number of trainable parameters than other competing architectures. We also performed a controlled benchmark of SegNet and other architectures on both road scenes and SUN RGB-D indoor scene segmentation tasks. We show that SegNet provides good performance with competitive inference time and more efficient inference memory-wise as compared to other architectures. We also provide a Caffe implementation of SegNet and a web demo at http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/projects/segnet/.},

Codebooks are usually constructed by using a method such as k-means to cluster the descriptor vectors of patches sampled either densely ('textons') or sparsely ('bags of features' based on keypoints or salience measures) from a set of training images. This works well for texture analysis in homogeneous images, but the images that arise in natural object recognition tasks have far less uniform statistics. We show that for dense sampling, k-means over-adapts to this, clustering centres almost exclusively around the densest few regions in descriptor space and thus failing to code other informative regions. This gives suboptimal codes that are no better than using randomly selected centres. We describe a scalable acceptance-radius based clusterer that generates better codebooks and study its performance on several image classification tasks. We also show that dense representations outperform equivalent keypoint based ones on these tasks and that SVM or Mutual Information based feature selection starting from a dense codebook further improves the performance. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

abstract = {Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) research aims to develop a perceptual model to evaluate the quality of distorted images automatically and accurately without access to the non-distorted reference images. The state-of-the-art general purpose BIQA methods can be classified into two categories according to the types of features used. The first includes handcrafted features which rely on the statistical regularities of natural images. These, however, are not suitable for images containing text and artificial graphics. The second includes learning-based features which invariably require large codebook or supervised codebook updating procedures to obtain satisfactory performance. These are time-consuming and not applicable in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel general purpose BIQA method based on high order statistics aggregation (HOSA), requiring only a small codebook. HOSA consists of three steps. First, local normalized image patches are extracted as local features through a regular grid, and a codebook containing 100 codewords is constructed by K-means clustering. In addition to the mean of each cluster, the diagonal covariance and coskewness (i.e., dimension-wise variance and skewness) of clusters are also calculated. Second, each local feature is softly assigned to several nearest clusters and the differences of high order statistics (mean, variance and skewness) between local features and corresponding clusters are softly aggregated to build the global quality aware image representation. Finally, support vector regression is adopted to learn the mapping between perceptual features and subjective opinion scores. The proposed method has been extensively evaluated on ten image databases with both simulated and realistic image distortions, and shows highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art BIQA methods.},

abstract = {General purpose blind image quality assessment (BIQA) has been recently attracting significant attention in the fields of image processing, vision and machine learning. State-of-the-art BIQA methods usually learn to evaluate the image quality by regression from human subjective scores of the training samples. However, these methods need a large number of human scored images for training, and lack an explicit explanation of how the image quality is affected by image local features. An interesting question is then: can we learn for effective BIQA without using human scored images? This paper makes a good effort to answer this question. We partition the distorted images into overlapped patches, and use a percentile pooling strategy to estimate the local quality of each patch. Then a quality-aware clustering (QAC) method is proposed to learn a set of centroids on each quality level. These centroids are then used as a codebook to infer the quality of each patch in a given image, and subsequently a perceptual quality score of the whole image can be obtained. The proposed QAC based BIQA method is simple yet effective. It not only has comparable accuracy to those methods using human scored images in learning, but also has merits such as high linearity to human perception of image quality, real-time implementation and availability of image local quality map. 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Reliable and economic methods for assessing image quality are essential for designing better imaging systems. Although reliable psychophysical methods are available for assessing perceptual image quality with the help of human subjects, the cost of performing such experiments prevents their use for evaluating large amounts of image material. This has led to an increasing demand for objective methods for estimating image quality. The perceived quality of an image is usually determined by several underlying perceptual attributes such as sharpness and noisiness. In the accompanying paper [J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 13, 1166-1177 (1996)] it is demonstrated that the relationships between images on the one hand and judgments on attributes and overall quality by subjects on the other hand can be characterized in a multidimensional perceptual space. In this perceptual space the images are represented by points, and the strengths of their perceptual attributes are modeled by the projections of these image positions onto the attribute axes. In analogy with the perceptual space we will introduce a psychometric space in which the positions of the images are determined by objective measures on the images. In the case of images degraded by blur and noise the stimulus coordinates are functions of the estimated spread of the blurring kernel and the estimated standard deviation of the noise, respectively. According to the model presented in this paper, the perceptual attributes of images can be estimated in three steps. In the first step the physical parameters (blur spread and noise standard deviation) are estimated from the images. In the second step these estimates are used to position the images in psychometric space. In the third step the attribute strengths are derived by projecting the alter image positions onto the attribute axes. We show that the attributes and the quality thus estimated correlate well with the perceived attributes and quality.},

abstract = {In this paper the problem of quality assessment of images containing various types of distortions is concerned. Many image quality metrics proposed during last decade are quite well correlated with human perception of various kinds of distortions with the assumption that only a single type of distortions is present in the image. One of the main reasons of such approach is the lack of datasets containing subjective quality assessment results of multiply distorted images. However, after the development of LIVE Multiply Distorted Image Quality Database, a new challenge related to verification of usability of known metrics as well as the development of new ones has appeared. In this paper, the results of such verification is presented not only for some well-known metrics but also for recently proposed combined metrics together with the proposed new combined metrics optimized for multiply distorted images. The new metrics outperform previously proposed ones in the aspect of linear correlation with subjective evaluations of images containing multiple distortions.

abstract = {As an extension of Discrete and Complex Wavelet Transform, Quaternion Wavelet Transform (QWT) has attracted extensive attention in the past few years, because it can provide better analytic representation for 2D images. The QWT of an image consists of four parts, i.e., one magnitude part and three phase parts. The magnitude is nearly shift-invariant, which characterizes features at any spatial location, and the three phases represent the structure of these features. This indicates that QWT is more powerful in representing image structures, and thus is suitable for image quality evaluation. In this paper, an efficient and effective Camera Image Quality Metric (CIQM) is proposed based on QWT, which is utilized to describe the intrinsic structures of an image. For an image, it is first decomposed by QWT with three scales. Then, for each scale, the magnitude and entropy of the subband coefficients, and natural scene statistics of the third phase are calculated. The magnitude is utilized to describe the generalized spectral behavior, and the entropy is used to encode the generalized information of distortions. Since the third phase of QWT is considered to be texture feature, the natural scene statistics of the third phase of QWT is used to measure structure degradations in the proposed method. All these features reflect the self-similarity and independency of image content, which can effectively reflect image distortions. Finally, random forest is utilized to build the quality model. Experiments conducted on three camera image databases and two multiply distorted image databases have proved that CIQM outperforms the relevant state-of-the-art models for both authentically distorted images and multiply distorted images.},

abstract = {We describe an innovative methodology for determining the quality of digital images. The method is based on measuring the variance of the expected entropy of a given image upon a set of predefined directions. Entropy can be calculated on a local basis by using a spatial/spatial-frequency distribution as an approximation for a probability density function. The generalized R{\'{e}}nyi entropy and the normalized pseudo-Wigner distribution (PWD) have been selected for this purpose. As a consequence, a pixel-by-pixel entropy value can be calculated, and therefore entropy histograms can be generated as well. The variance of the expected entropy is measured as a function of the directionality, and it has been taken as an anisotropy indicator. For this purpose, directional selectivity can be attained by using an oriented 1-D PWD implementation. Our main purpose is to show how such an anisotropy measure can be used as a metric to assess both the fidelity and quality of images. Experimental results show that an index such as this presents some desirable features that resemble those from an ideal image quality function, constituting a suitable quality index for natural images. Namely, in-focus, noise-free natural images have shown a maximum of this metric in comparison with other degraded, blurred, or noisy versions. This result provides a way of identifying in-focus, noise-free images from other degraded versions, allowing an automatic and nonreference classification of images according to their relative quality. It is also shown that the new measure is well correlated with classical reference metrics such as the peak signal-to-noise ratio.},

abstract = {We propose a novel image denoising strategy based on an enhanced sparse representation in transform domain. The enhancement of the sparsity is achieved by grouping similar 2-D image fragments (e.g., blocks) into 3-D data arrays which we call "groups." Collaborative filtering is a special procedure developed to deal with these 3-D groups. We realize it using the three successive steps: 3-D transformation of a group, shrinkage of the transform spectrum, and inverse 3-D transformation. The result is a 3-D estimate that consists of the jointly filtered grouped image blocks. By attenuating the noise, the collaborative filtering reveals even the finest details shared by grouped blocks and, at the same time, it preserves the essential unique features of each individual block. The filtered blocks are then returned to their original positions. Because these blocks are overlapping, for each pixel, we obtain many different estimates which need to be combined. Aggregation is a particular averaging procedure which is exploited to take advantage of this redundancy. A significant improvement is obtained by a specially developed collaborative Wiener filtering. An algorithm based on this novel denoising strategy and its efficient implementation are presented in full detail; an extension to color-image denoising is also developed. The experimental results demonstrate that this computationally scalable algorithm achieves state-of-the-art denoising performance in terms of both peak signal-to-noise ratio and subjective visual quality.},

We suggest that this effect is consistent with a clean, natural image corrupted by white noise. We propose a model for this effect, and use it to estimate noise standard deviation in corrupted natural images. In particular, our results suggest that classical benchmark images used in low-level vision are actually noisy and can be cleaned up.

It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone.

For high contrast maskers at all frequencies, signal thresholds were related to masking contrast by power functions with exponents near 0.6. For a range of low masking contrasts, signal thresholds were reduced by the masker. For the wide fields, high contrast masking tuning functions peaked at the signal frequency, were slightly asymmetric, and had approximately invariant half-maximum frequencies that lie 3/4 octave below and 1 octave above the signal frequency. The corresponding low contrast tuning functions exhibited peak threshold reduction at the signal frequency, with half-minimum frequencies at roughly +/- 0.25 octaves. For the narrow fields, the masking tuning functions were much broader at both low and high masking contrasts. A masking model is presented that encompasses contrast detection, discrimination, and masking phenomena. Central constructs of the model include a linear spatial frequency filter, a nonlinear transducer, and a process of spatial pooling that acts at low contrasts only.},

@article{Zhang2014cdiivine,
abstract = {It is widely known that the wavelet coefficients of natural scenes possess certain statistical regularities which can be affected by the presence of distortions. The DIIVINE (Distortion Identification-based Image Verity and Integrity Evaluation) algorithm is a successful no-reference image quality assessment (NR IQA) algorithm, which estimates quality based on changes in these regularities. However, DIIVINE operates based on real-valued wavelet coefficients, whereas the visual appearance of an image can be strongly determined by both the magnitude and phase information. In this paper, we present a complex extension of the DIIVINE algorithm (called C-DIIVINE), which blindly assesses image quality based on the complex Gaussian scale mixture model corresponding to the complex version of the steerable pyramid wavelet transform. Specifically, we applied three commonly used distribution models to fit the statistics of the wavelet coefficients: (1) the complex generalized Gaussian distribution is used to model the wavelet coefficient magnitudes, (2) the generalized Gaussian distribution is used to model the coefficients' relative magnitudes, and (3) the wrapped Cauchy distribution is used to model the coefficients' relative phases. All these distributions have characteristic shapes that are consistent across different natural images but change significantly in the presence of distortions. We also employ the complex wavelet structural similarity index to measure degradation of the correlations across image scales, which serves as an important indicator of the subbands' energy distribution and the loss of alignment of local spectral components contributing to image structure. Experimental results show that these complex extensions allow C-DIIVINE to yield a substantial improvement in predictive performance as compared to its predecessor, and highly competitive performance relative to other recent no-reference algorithms. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

The new method, called DErivative Statistics-based Image QUality Eval-uator (DESIQUE), extracts image quality-related statistical features at two image scales in both the spatial and frequency domains, upon which a two-stage framework is employed to evaluate image quality. In the spatial domain, normalized luminance values of an image are modeled in two ways: point-wise based statistics for sin-gle pixel values and pairwise-based log-derivative statistics for the relationship of pixel pairs. In the frequency domain, log-Gabor filters are used to extract the high frequency component of an image, which is also modeled by the log-derivative statistics. All of these statistics are characterized by a generalized Gaussian distribution model, the parameters of which form the underlying features of the proposed method. Experiment results show that DESIQUE not only leads to considerable performance improvements, but also maintains high computational efficiency.},

@article{Hughes1996,
abstract = {A great deal of evidence suggests that early in processing, retinal images are filtered by parallel, spatial frequency selective channels. We attempt to incorporate this view of early vision with the principle of global precedence, which holds that Gestalt-like processes sensitive to global image configurations tend to dominate local feature processing in human pattern perception. Global precedence is inferred from the pattern of reaction times observed when visual patterns contain multiple cues at different levels of spatial scale. Specifically, it is frequently observed that global processing times are largely unaffected by conflicting local cues, but local processing times are substantially lengthened by conflicting global cues. The asymmetry of these effects suggests the dominant role of global configurations. Since global spatial information is effectively represented by low spatial frequencies, global precedence potentially implies a low frequency dominance. The thesis is that low spatial frequencies tend to be available before information carried by higher frequency bands, producing a coarse-to-fine temporal order in visual spatial perception. It is suggested that a variety of factors contribute to the ''prior entry'' of low frequency information, including the high contrast gain of the magnocellular pathway the amplitude spectra typical of natural images, and inhibitory interactions between the parallel frequency-tuned channels. Evidence suggesting a close relationship between global precedence and spatial frequency channels is provided by observations that the essential features of the global precedence effect are obtained using patterns consisting of low and high frequency sinusoids. The hypothesis that these asymmetric interference effects are due to interactions between parallel spatial channels is supported by an analysis of reaction times (RTs), which shows that RTs to redundant low and high frequency cues produce less facilitation than predictions that assume the channels are independent. In view of previous work showing that global precedence depends upon the low frequency content of the stimuli, we suggest that low spatial frequencies represent the sine qua non for the dominance of configurational cues in human pattern perception, and that this configurational dominance reflects the microgenesis of visual pattern perception. This general view of the temporal dynamics of visual pattern recognition is discussed, is considered from an evolutionary perspective, and is related to certain statistical regularities in natural scenes. Potential adaptive advantages of an interactive parallel architecture that confers an initial processing advantage to low resolution information are explored.},

The aim of blind image quality assessment (BIQA) methods is to evaluate the perceptual quality of a distorted image without any prior information regarding its reference image. Although some impressive image quality metrics have been proposed, due to the complexity of the human visual system and the lack of a reference image, designing an image quality metric which accurately predicts human judgments is still a challenging issue. In this paper, a low complexity wavelet-based image quality assessment is proposed. Firstly, the interaction of fine and coarse details of the image, which is extracted by Haar wavelet, is analyzed. In the proposed approach, the joint statistics of two normalized high frequency subbands which indicate coarse and fine structures is utilized for extracting features. Actually, analyzing the relation between image details of different granularities is the main idea of the proposed method. After feature extraction phase, support vector regression (SVR) is adopted in order to provide a quality score. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed low complexity approach.},

Extensive experiments are conducted using four popular large-size image databases and two multiply distorted image databases, and results validate the superiority of our approach over modern IQA measures in efficiency and efficacy.

abstract = {Second-order textures-patterns that cannot be detected by mechanisms sensitive only to luminance changes-are ubiquitous in visual scenes, but the neuronal mechanisms mediating perception of such stimuli are not well understood. We used an adaptation protocol to measure neural activity in the human brain selective for the orientation of second-order textures. Functional MRI (fMRI) responses were measured in three subjects to presentations of first- and second-order probe gratings after adapting to a high-contrast first- or second-order grating that was either parallel or orthogonal to the probe gratings. First-order (LM) stimuli were generated by modulating the stimulus luminance. Second-order stimuli were generated by modulating the contrast (CM) or orientation (OM) of a first-order carrier. We used four combinations of adapter and probe stimuli: LM:LM, CM:CM, OM:OM, and LM:OM. The fourth condition tested for cross-modal adaptation with first-order adapter and second-order probe stimuli. Attention was diverted from the stimulus by a demanding task at fixation. Both first- and second-order stimuli elicited orientation-selective adaptation in multiple cortical visual areas, including V1, V2, V3, V3A/B, a newly identified visual area anterior to dorsal V3 that we have termed LO1, hV4, and VO1. For first-order stimuli (condition LM:LM), the adaptation was no larger in extrastriate areas than in V1, implying that the orientation-selective first-order (luminance) adaptation originated in V1. For second-order stimuli (conditions CM:CM and OM:OM), the magnitude of adaptation, relative to the absolute response magnitude, was significantly larger in VO1 (and for condition CM:CM, also in V3A/B and LO1) than in V1, suggesting that second-order stimulus orientation was extracted by additional processing after V1. There was little difference in the amplitude of adaptation between the second-order conditions. No consistent effect of adaptation was found in the cross-modal condition LM:OM, in agreement with psychophysical evidence for weak interactions between first- and second-order stimuli and computational models of separate mechanisms for first- and second-order visual processing.},

We propose a norm on jet space which we use to induce a metric on the orbifold. The metric tensor shows that the orbifold is intrinsically curved.

Color saliency boosting is designed as a generic method easily adaptable to existing feature detectors.

'Crowding' occurs when objects are too close together and features from several objects are combined into a jumbled percept. Here, we review the explosion of studies on crowding--in grating discrimination, letter and face recognition, visual search, selective attention, and reading--and find a universal principle, the Bouma law. The critical spacing required to prevent crowding is equal for all objects, although the effect is weaker between dissimilar objects. Furthermore, critical spacing at the cortex is independent of object position, and critical spacing at the visual field is proportional to object distance from fixation. The region where object spacing exceeds critical spacing is the 'uncrowded window'. Observers cannot recognize objects outside of this window and its size limits the speed of reading and search.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 1992-2012 IEEE. The human visual system is highly adaptive to extract structure information for scene perception, and structure character is widely used in perception-oriented image processing works. However, the existing structure descriptors mainly describe the luminance contrast of a local region, but cannot effectively represent the spatial correlation of structure. In this paper, we introduce a novel structure descriptor according to the orientation selectivity mechanism in the primary visual cortex. Research on cognitive neuroscience indicate that the arrangement of excitatory and inhibitory cortex cells arise orientation selectivity in a local receptive field, within which the primary visual cortex performs visual information extraction for scene understanding. Inspired by the orientation selectivity mechanism, we compute the correlations among pixels in a local region based on the similarities of their preferred orientation. By imitating the arrangement of the excitatory/inhibitory cells, the correlations between a central pixel and its local neighbors are binarized, and the spatial correlation is represented with a set of binary values, which is named the orientation selectivity-based pattern. Then, taking both the gradient magnitude and the orientation selectivity-based pattern into account, a rotation invariant structure descriptor is introduced. The proposed structure descriptor is applied in texture classification and reduced reference image quality assessment, as two different application domains to verify its generality and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that the orientation selectivity-based structure descriptor is robust to disturbance, and can effectively represent the structure degradation caused by different types of distortion.},
